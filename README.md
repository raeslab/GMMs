# GMMs
A manually curated database of human gut metabolic modules, based on extensive literature review, as described in *[Vieira-Silva et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201688)*

### Format
Module reactions are listed following their order in the module. Tab-separated reactions indicate alternative reactions (OR operation), while return- and
comma-separated reactions are all required for process completeness (AND operation).
